# TMDB-Trakt-Syncer

This Python script syncs user ratings for Movies, TV Shows, and episodes both ways between [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/) and [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/). Existing ratings are not overwritten. The script is designed to work on any operating system that supports Python, including Windows, Linux, Mac, and ChromeOS. If you're interested in syncing ratings between Trakt, Plex, IMDb, and TMDB, I recommend the following projects: [PlexTraktSync](https://github.com/Taxel/PlexTraktSync), [IMDb-Trakt-Syncer](https://github.com/RileyXX/IMDb-Trakt-Syncer), and [TMDB-Trakt-Syncer](https://github.com/RileyXX/TMDB-Trakt-Syncer).

## Installation Instructions:
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install the script by executing `python -m pip install TMDBTraktSyncer` in command line.
3. Login to [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications) and create a new API application named `TMDbTraktSyncer`. In the "Redirect uri" field, enter `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob`, then save the application.
4. Login to [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api/) and create a new API application. Choose "Developer" and accept the terms. Fill out the application form as follows: 
   - Type of use: `Personal`
   - Application name: `TMDB-Trakt-Sync`
   - Application URL: `localhost`
   - Application summary: `Use TMDB API and Trakt API to sync user ratings between platforms. https://github.com/RileyXX/TMDB-Trakt-Syncer`
   - Fill in the rest of the fields as desired and submit the form. Your API keys will be generated instantly.
5. Run the script by executing `TMDBTraktSyncer` in the command line.
6. Follow the prompts during the first run. You will need to enter your Trakt client ID and client secret from step 3, as well as your `tmdb_v4_token` from step 4. Please note that these details are saved insecurely as `credentials.txt` in the same folder as the script.
7. Setup is complete. The script will continue running and syncing your ratings. You can monitor its progress in the command line.
