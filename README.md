# TMDB-Trakt-Syncer
This python script will sync user ratings for Movies and TV Shows both ways between Trakt and TMDB. Ratings already set will not be overwritten. This script should work on an OS where python is supported (Windows, Linux, Mac, ChromeOS, etc). If you're looking to sync your ratings between Trakt, Plex, IMDB, and TMDB then these are my recommended projects: [PlexTraktSync](https://github.com/Taxel/PlexTraktSync), [IMDb-Trakt-Syncer](https://github.com/RileyXX/IMDb-Trakt-Syncer) & [TMDB-Trakt-Syncer](https://github.com/RileyXX/TMDB-Trakt-Syncer).
## Install Instructions:
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 
2. Run `python -m pip install TMDbTraktSyncer` in command line.
3. Login to [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications) and create a new API application. We will name it `TMDbTraktSyncer`. In the Redirect uri field enter `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob` then Save. 
4. Login to [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api/) and create a new API application. Choose developer, accept the terms and start filling out the application form. For type of use `Personal`. For application name we will call it `TMDB-Trakt-Sync`. For application url enter `localhost`. For application summary enter `Use TMDB api and Trakt api to sync ratings user ratings between platforms. https://github.com/RileyXX/TMDB-Trakt-Syncer`. Fill in the rest of the fields with whatever you want and submit. Your api keys will be instantly generated.
